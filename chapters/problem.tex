\chapter{Problem Statement}
\label{problem}

The amount of data is rapidly increasing and it is estimated that 20\% of the world's data have been collected the past
few years~\cite{10.1109/SPW.2015.27,big_data_better_worse}. People constantly producing and publishing data about themselves
leaving a constant moving digital fingerprint over the Internet--their personal data. The type, quantity and value of personal data
being collected are vast~\cite{emergence_new_assets_wef}: banks accounts, medical records, employment data, web searches, sites visited,
likes, dislikes, product purchase histories, quotes, tweets, texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, personal moments, emotions
as well as coordinations of real-world locations.

\section{Regulations}\label{problem:regulations}

The recent approval of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)~\cite{gdpr} in 2016 by the European Commission (EC)
imposes new obligations on data controllers and processors in contrast to the previously adopted Data Protection Directive (DPR)~\cite{eu-46ec-1995}.
New legislation aims in the extension of responsibility and accountability requirements of organizations also demanding explicit
consent of the data subjects (person) securing their right to withdraw, and to be forgotten~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17}.

The key changes of the new data protection law introduced by the GDPR in contrast to the DPR is are~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organisations based outside EU that process personal data of EU residents are applicable to the new legislation
    \item All EU member states are obliged to a single set of rules
    \item The responsibility and accountability requirements of organisations are extending
    \item EU residents are empowered with explicit consent over their data with the right to be forgotten
\end{itemize}
