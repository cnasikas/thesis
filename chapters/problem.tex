\section{Overview}
\label{problem:overview}

The amount of data is rapidly increasing and it is estimated that 20\% of the world's data have been collected the past
few years~\cite{10.1109/SPW.2015.27,big_data_better_worse}. Data storage rapid growth contributes to a substantial shift in economy power and source of economic value. We have entered to the area of Big Data. The impact of Big Data is huge and the consequences are far reaching.

Data is a strategic asset that allows companies to be competitive. The value of raw data varies from a hundred cents to over several hundred dollars per individual~\cite{pr_data_cost_1, pr_data_cost_2, pr_data_cost_3}. The more is analyzed, modified and enriched, the more its value increasing.

People constantly producing and publishing data about themselves
leaving a constant moving digital fingerprint over the Internet; their personal data. The type, quantity and value of personal data
being collected are vast~\cite{emergence_new_assets_wef}: banks accounts, medical records, employment data, web searches, sites visited,
likes, dislikes, product purchase histories, quotes, tweets, texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, personal moments, emotions
as well as coordinations of real-world locations.

Personal data are gathered by few big tech companies being the rightful owners---personal data is owned by the institution that collects them---and privatizing them. This gave rise to the data broker and mining industry creating data marketplaces~\cite{dawex, q_dx, datastreamx} and trade platforms where data can be sold and bought for a price. All data is potentially for sale.

Personal data can be gathered as follows~\cite{emergence_new_assets_wef}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Volunteered data: data shared explicitly by the individuals
  \item Observed data: data captured by recording actions of individuals
  \item Inferred data: data based on analysis of individuals volunteered or observed data
\end{itemize}

Big data can not exist without personal input and wide-scale cooperation. Free services by companies---in return for user input--- is an example of consumer-driven big data; leisure time transforms into productive work.

As some put it~\cite{data_new_oil_01,data_new_oil_02,data_new_oil_03,data_new_oil_04,data_new_oil_05,data_new_oil_05,data_new_oil_06,data_new_oil_07,data_new_oil_08,data_new_oil_09}: Data is the new oil.

Treating personal data as a natural resource is a huge problem and should be prevented.

The current centralized model in which third-parties collect and control massive amount of personal data should be questioned.
Individuals have little or no control over their personal data and how they are used growing that way a public concern about
user privacy.

Personal data should be in total control by the person that produce them, the rightful owner. Individuals should be empowered
with the ability to own their personal data, to control how are been collected, used, shared and by whom.

Nevertheless, the ability to process large volumes of personal information has still resulted in some benefits for individuals and society at large. Big data has positive implications for urban planners who want to design smarter cities, health-care professionals who want to predict epidemics and cure diseases, and engineers who want to identify or even predict new problems to solve.

\section{Regulations}\label{problem:regulations}

The EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (DPR)~\cite{eu-46ec-1995} defines personal data as follows:
\blockquote{
personal data shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;
}
However there has been a clear notion that the data subject can potentially identified by pseudo-identifiers~\cite{pii}.
In the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)~\cite{gdpr} by EU this has been formalised as:
\blockquote{
a data subject is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by means reasonably likely to be used by the controller or by any other natural or legal person
}

The recent approval of GDPR~\cite{gdpr} in 2016 by the European Commission (EC)
imposes new obligations on data controllers and processors in contrast to the previously adopted Data Protection Directive (DPR)~\cite{eu-46ec-1995}.
New legislation aims in the extension of responsibility and accountability requirements of organizations also demanding explicit
consent of the data subjects (person) securing their right to withdraw, and to be forgotten~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17}.

The key changes of the new data protection law introduced by the GDPR in contrast to the DPR is are~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organisations based outside EU that process personal data of EU residents are applicable to the new legislation
    \item All EU member states are obliged to a single set of rules
    \item The responsibility and accountability requirements of organisations are extending
    \item EU residents are empowered with explicit consent over their data with the right to be forgotten
\end{itemize}

Data controllers and processors is required to demonstrate to have implemented all the technical and organizational measures needed to ensure the security of the data and the fulfillment of all data protection fundamental principles.

The GDPR increase self-responsibility, and therefore accountability, with particular reference to the processing of sensitive data, such as health and medical data. Privacy lie at the very center of all the new legal and technical paradigms of compliance under the Regulation.

So, data controllers are required to implement all measures and safeguards to ensure that any product or service they provide in is fully in line with the key principles laid down by the GDPR imposing also the obligation to not collect unessential personal data.

Finally, to empower the data subject and have total control over her data, consent rules and a number of fundamental rights, such as the right to be forgotten, have been further consolidated, reinforced or introduced in the GDPR. Therefore, the data subject's will becomes a priority and impose greater attention by the data controllers.

\section{Motivations for applications}\label{problem:motivations}

Blockchain has a very useful set of properties that can been utilized and leveraged. Above all, Blockchain is decentralized: there is no central authority regulating and governing the recording of the transactions on the ledger. The ledger is maintained by the participants of the network, where participation is free, and the global state of the ledger is agreed by a consensus mechanism (ยง~\ref{blockchain:consensus_mechanisms}). That empowers the users of the network with total ownership over their assets---assets can be anything ranging form a token, a contract, datasets, medical records, chain-of-evidence documents, or citizenship documents---through a system that guarantees security where any node can be malicious. The elimination of the need for a trusted central authority has the effect of making the system more trustworthy and reliable.

Blockchain provides digital timestamping. All the transaction in the Blockchain are stored in chronological order so anyone can see if a transaction A precedes transaction B. Timestamping could be useful in financial contracts, establishing precedence for copyright and auction bids~\cite{bl_auditability}.

Another important feature of Blockchain is that of immutability (or transaction finality): all transactions can not be altered or deleted once they are confirmed and recorded on the Blockchain; transactions are irreversible.

The combination of timestamping and immutability, along with Blockchain's consensus mechanism, leads to  accountability~\cite{10.1007/978-3-540-46588-1_20}, auditability and non-repudiation~\cite{non_repudiation}---the ability
to definitively verify authenticity of statements recorded on the Blockchain~\cite{bl_auditability}.

Those very useful properties make Blockchain a distributed immutable, tamper-proof, transparent and audit log that any attempt to tamper Blockchain is immediately evident and easily detectable allowing the users to confirm whether the service operates in the intended way and have a proof of malicious behavior otherwise.

Data on the Blockchain are stored on every node of the network and every node keeps a copy of the public ledger. Due to data replication there is no single point of failure (SPOF) and the system is fault-tolerant and resistant to malicious and denial-of-service attacks (DoS attacks).

Blockchain technology can be used for a wide variety of applications including document provenance tracking, digital assets, financial services, copyright, voting, distributed storage, donation, education, medical records, data exchange, Internet of Things (IoT) to name a few.

Blockchain technology is a perfect candidate for addressing the problem of personal data privatization and privacy. Blockchain can play an increasingly significant and fundamental role in enable data sharing in compliance with the GDPR.

A dynamic consent mechanism promoting users empowerment can be built with the use of smart contracts determining data accessibility. The immutability and auditability of blockchain blocks and transactions, and cryptographical guarantees provided, can enforce liability, transparency and accountability without compromising privacy and security.

Furthermore, distributed consent for research trials can increase anonymous data samples~\cite{ibm} allowing Big Data Analytics in compliance with GDPR. In addition, blockchain can significantly reduce data transaction costs between entities and increase transaction efficiency

Like all technology, blockchain has limitations. It is argued that blockchain is not suited for high performance transactions or as a database replacement. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain and its necessity for a consensus mechanism the transaction rate remains quite low compared to financial services~\cite{Sompolinsky2015, Zohar:2015:BUH:2817191.2701411}. Blockchain is not made for big data. The amount of data that blockchain can store and process is very limited so off-chain data frameworks are needed.
