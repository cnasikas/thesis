\chapter{Problem Statement}
\label{problem}

The amount of data is rapidly increasing and it is estimated that 20\% of the world's data have been collected the past
few years~\cite{10.1109/SPW.2015.27,big_data_better_worse}. People constantly producing and publishing data about themselves
leaving a constant moving digital fingerprint over the Internet--their personal data. The type, quantity and value of personal data
being collected are vast~\cite{emergence_new_assets_wef}: banks accounts, medical records, employment data, web searches, sites visited,
likes, dislikes, product purchase histories, quotes, tweets, texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, personal moments, emotions
as well as coordinations of real-world locations.

Personal data are gathered by few big tech companies being the rightful owners-personal data is owned by the institution that collects them-and privatising them.
As some put it~\cite{data_new_oil_01,data_new_oil_02,data_new_oil_03,data_new_oil_04,data_new_oil_05,data_new_oil_05,data_new_oil_06,data_new_oil_07,data_new_oil_08,data_new_oil_09}: Data is the new oil. Treating personal data as a natural resource is a huge problem and should be prevented. \note{Say more... Political point of view}

Personal data can be gathered as~\cite{emergence_new_assets_wef}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Volunteered data: data shared explicitly by the individuals
  \item Observed data: data captured by recording actions of individuals
  \item Inferred data: data based on analysis of individuals volunteered or observed data
\end{itemize}

The current centralised model in which third-parties collect and control massive amount of personal data should be questioned.
Individuals have little or no control over their personal data and how they are used growing that way a public concern about
user privacy.

Personal data should be in total control by the person that produce them, the rightful owner. Individuals should be empowered
with the ability to own their personal data, to control how are been collected, used, shared and by whom.

\section{Regulations}\label{problem:regulations}

The EU directive 95/46/EC~\cite{eu-46ec-1995} defines personal data as follows:
\blockquote{
personal data shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;
}
However there has been a clear notion that the data subject can potentially identified by pseudo-identifiers~\cite{wiki:pii}.
In the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)~\cite{gdpr} by EU this has been formalised as:
\blockquote{
a data subject is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by means reasonably likely to be used by the controller or by any other natural or legal person
}

The recent approval of GDPR~\cite{gdpr} in 2016 by the European Commission (EC)
imposes new obligations on data controllers and processors in contrast to the previously adopted Data Protection Directive (DPR)~\cite{eu-46ec-1995}.
New legislation aims in the extension of responsibility and accountability requirements of organizations also demanding explicit
consent of the data subjects (person) securing their right to withdraw, and to be forgotten~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17}.

The key changes of the new data protection law introduced by the GDPR in contrast to the DPR is are~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organisations based outside EU that process personal data of EU residents are applicable to the new legislation
    \item All EU member states are obliged to a single set of rules
    \item The responsibility and accountability requirements of organisations are extending
    \item EU residents are empowered with explicit consent over their data with the right to be forgotten
\end{itemize}
