\section{Overview}
\label{problem:overview}

The amount of data is rapidly increasing and it is estimated that 20\% of the world's data have been collected over the past few years~\cite{10.1109/SPW.2015.27,big_data_better_worse}. We have entered the era of Big Data. The impact of Big Data is huge and the consequences are far reaching.

Data is considered an asset that allows companies to be competitive. The value of raw data varies from a hundred cents to over several hundred dollars per individual~\cite{pr_data_cost_1, pr_data_cost_2, pr_data_cost_3}. The more it is being analyzed, the more its value increases.

People constantly produce and publishe data about themselves
leaving a constant moving digital fingerprint all over the Internet; their personal data. The type, quantity and value of personal data being collected are vast~\cite{emergence_new_assets_wef}: bank accounts, medical records, employment data, web searches, sites visited,
likes and dislikes, product purchase histories, quotes, tweets, texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, personal moments, emotions as well as coordinates of real-world locations.

Personal data are gathered by few a big tech companies which are the rightful owners---personal data is owned by the institution that collects them---and privatizes them. This gave rise to the data broker and mining industry creating data marketplaces~\cite{dawex, q_dx, datastreamx} and trade platforms where data can be sold and bought for a price. All data is potentially for sale without the consent of the rightful owners, the users.

Personal data can be gathered in three ways~\cite{emergence_new_assets_wef}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Volunteered data: data shared explicitly by the individuals
  \item Observed data: data captured by recording actions of individuals
  \item Inferred data: data based on analysis of individuals
\end{itemize}

Big data cannot exist without personal input and user cooperation. Companies create free services in return for user input leading to consumer-driven big data collection.

As some put it~\cite{data_new_oil_01,data_new_oil_02,data_new_oil_03,data_new_oil_04,data_new_oil_05,data_new_oil_05,data_new_oil_06,data_new_oil_07,data_new_oil_08,data_new_oil_09}: Data is the new oil. Treating personal data as a natural resource is a huge problem and should be prevented.

The current centralized model in which third-parties collect and control massive amount of personal data should be questioned. Individuals have little or no control over their personal data and how they are used. For this reason there is a growing public concern about user privacy.

Personal data should be in total control of the person that produce them, the rightful owner. Individuals should be empowered with the ability to own their personal data, to control how data are being collected, used, shared and by whom.

Nevertheless, the ability to process large volumes of personal information still has benefits for individuals and the societies at large. Creating Open Data is an important goal of the research community and has a lot of advantages. By allowing researchers to access others datasets, accountability, fault detection and trust in the validity of prior research is achieved~\cite{open_data_1}. The Open Data Movement is a paradigm of free data distribution without limits or copyrights and patents. However, there is a public concern about privacy of research participants which could be subversive for data collection; the researchers are trusted with privacy and confidentiality. As data can be private, sensitive and protected by privacy disclosure acts making data processing impossible or inefficient.

In our solution, presented in the following chapters, we try to address these privacy concerns by enabling the data sharing and the data processing in a privacy preserving manner making anyone accountable for their actions.

\section{Regulations}\label{problem:regulations}

The EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (DPR)~\cite{eu-46ec-1995} defines personal data as follows:
\blockquote{
personal data shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;
}
However there has been a clear notion that the data subject can potentially identified by pseudo-identifiers~\cite{pii}.
In the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)~\cite{gdpr} by EU this has been formalised as:
\blockquote{
a data subject is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by means reasonably likely to be used by the controller or by any other natural or legal person
}

The recent approval of GDPR~\cite{gdpr} in 2016 by the European Commission (EC)
imposes new obligations on data controllers and processors in contrast to the previously adopted Data Protection Directive (DPR)~\cite{eu-46ec-1995}.
New legislation aims in the extension of responsibility and accountability requirements of organizations also demanding explicit
consent of the data subjects (person) securing their right to withdraw, and to be forgotten~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17}.

The key changes of the new data protection law introduced by the GDPR in contrast to the DPR is are~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organisations based outside EU that process personal data of EU residents are applicable to the new legislation
    \item All EU member states are obliged to a single set of rules
    \item The responsibility and accountability requirements of organisations are extending
    \item EU residents are empowered with explicit consent over their data with the right to be forgotten
\end{itemize}

Data controllers and processors is required to demonstrate to have implemented all the technical and organizational measures needed to ensure the security of the data~\cite{mhmd}.

The GDPR increase self-responsibility, and therefore accountability, with particular reference to the processing of sensitive data, such as health and medical data~\cite{mhmd}. Data controllers are required to implement all measures to ensure that any product or service they provide in is fully in line with the key principles laid down by the GDPR.

Finally, to empower the data subject and have total control over her data, consent rules and a number of fundamental rights, such as the right to be forgotten, have been reinforced or introduced in the GDPR and the data subject's will becomes a priority.

Data controllers can outsource data processing activities to data controllers. This relationship can be established though contracts or any binding legal act. Personal data can not be made available to third parties without data subject's consent as they should keep full control over their data. Data processors are not considered third party rather as an extension of data controller. That means that any activity put in place by the processors with the approval and instructions of the controller is considered as carried out within the premises of the organization itself~\cite{mhmd}. For example, a hospital acting as a data controller can outsource an anonymize operation, over the personal data of the hospital, which has collected, to a trusted data processor without any need to collect again patient's consent.

\section{Motivations for applications}\label{problem:motivations}

Blockchain has a very useful set of properties that can been utilized and leveraged. Above all, blockchain is decentralized: there is no central authority regulating and governing the recording of the transactions on the ledger. The ledger is maintained by the participants of the network, where participation is free, and the global state of the ledger is agreed by a consensus mechanism (ยง~\ref{blockchain:consensus_mechanisms}). That empowers the users of the network with total ownership over their assets---assets can be anything ranging from a token, a contract, datasets, medical records, chain-of-evidence documents, or citizenship documents---through a system that guarantees security where any node can be malicious. The elimination of the need for a trusted central authority has the effect of making the system more trustworthy and reliable.

Blockchain provides digital timestamping. All the transaction in the blockchain are stored in chronological order so anyone can see if a transaction A precedes a transaction B. Timestamping could be useful in financial contracts, establishing precedence for copyright and auction bids~\cite{bl_auditability}.

Another important feature of blockchain is that of immutability (or transaction finality): all transactions can not be altered or deleted once they are confirmed and recorded on the blockchain; transactions are irreversible.

The combination of timestamping and immutability, along with blockchain's consensus mechanism, leads to  accountability~\cite{10.1007/978-3-540-46588-1_20}, auditability and non-repudiation~\cite{non_repudiation}---the ability
to definitively verify authenticity of statements recorded in the blockchain~\cite{bl_auditability}.

Those very useful properties make the blockchain a distributed immutable, tamper-proof, transparent and audit log that any attempt to tamper with the  blockchain is immediately evident and easily detectable allowing the users to confirm whether the service operates in the intended way and have a proof of malicious behavior otherwise.

Data on the blockchain are stored on every node of the network and every node keeps a copy of the public ledger. Due to data replication there is no single point of failure (SPOF) and the system is fault-tolerant and resistant to malicious and denial-of-service attacks (DoS attacks).

Blockchain technology can be used for a wide variety of applications including document provenance tracking, digital assets, financial services, copyright, voting, distributed storage, donation, education, medical records, data exchange, Internet of Things (IoT) to name a few.

Blockchain technology is a perfect candidate for addressing the problem of personal data privatization and privacy. Blockchain can play an increasingly significant and fundamental role in enable data sharing in compliance with the GDPR.

Furthermore, distributed consent for research trials can increase anonymous data samples~\cite{ibm} allowing Big Data Analytics in compliance with the GDPR. In addition, blockchain can significantly reduce data transaction costs between entities and increase transaction efficiency.

Like all technology, blockchain has limitations. It is argued that blockchain is not suited for high performance transactions or as a database replacement. Due to the decentralized nature of the blockchain and its necessity for a consensus mechanism the transaction rate remains quite low compared to financial services~\cite{Sompolinsky2015, Zohar:2015:BUH:2817191.2701411}. Blockchain is not made for big data. The amount of data that a blockchain can store and process is very limited so off-chain data frameworks are needed.
