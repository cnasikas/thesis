\chapter{Smart Contracts}
\label{smart_contracts}

Blockchains could also incorporate the notion of smart contracts~\cite{ethreum}.
A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract~\cite{wiki:smart_contract}.
Smart contracts have been used primarily in association with cryptocurrencies. The most prominent smart contract implementation
is the Ethereum blockchain platform~\cite{ethreum}, known as a decentralized application, which implements a Turing complete language for writing smart contracts.
