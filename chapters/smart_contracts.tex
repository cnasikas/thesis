\chapter{Smart Contracts}
\label{smart_contracts}

A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract~\cite{FM548,wiki:smart_contract}.
The idea of smart contracts proposed in the early 1990s~\cite{FM548} and have been used primarily in association with cryptocurrencies enabling
parties to formally specify a cryptographically enforceable agreements~\cite{7163021}.

Bitcoin offers smart contracts through a stack-based scripting language that is not Turing-complete limiting the type of smart contracts one can create.
Numerous previous smart contract application atop Bitcoin (e.g., lottery\cite{Andrychowicz:2014:SMC:2650286.2650764,10.1007/978-3-662-44381-1_24},
verifiable computation~\cite{Kumaresan:2014:UBI:2660267.2660380}) have demostrated the difficulty of Bitcoin's scripting language~\cite{cryptoeprint:2015:675}.

Ethereum is the first Turing-complete decentralised smart contract framework. With Ethereum launch, the notion of DApps (decentralized applications) arised
and a lot of developers and companies are building numerous applications atop Ethereum such as prediction markets~\cite{augur,gnosis}, social media platforms~\cite{akasha,backfeed},
online gambling~\cite{etheroll,coinpoker} and video games~\cite{cryptokitties}. As of January 2018, there are more than 250 live DApps,
with hundreds more under development~\cite{wiki:ethereum}.

\section{Consent}
\label{smart_contract:consent}

Modeling dynamic consent in smart contracts should be carefully analyzed taking into account design issues that are related to smart contracts lifecycle, required state variables for storing contract’s information, and access restrictions to those variables.

Neisse et al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17} proposed the following three models for data accountability and provenance tracking that comply with the GDPR~\cite{gdpr}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Contract for a specific controller: A contract where the data subject creates a contract tailored for each data controller
  \item Contract for specific data: A contract where each subject’s data instance is shared among all data controllers
  \item Contract for multiple data subjects: A contract where the data controller specifies how the data from all subjects are treated from the controller
\end{enumerate}

The first contract is more adequate for sensitive data~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17}, such as health data, since a subject-controller relationship~\cite{Azaria2016} is being created where each patient has a different contract for each controller accessing their data, providing fine grained access control and provenance information. On the other hand, it has the highest cardinality among the others two types~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17}. The second contract suffers from direct linkability as a unique subject address is needed compromising patients’ privacy~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17}. Lastly, the third one has the lowest cardinality among the others but also has the lower level of customization due to the limited number of contract options~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NeisseSF17}.
