\section{Secure Multi party computation}
\label{future_work:mpc}

In the setting of multiparty computation, sets of two or more parties with private inputs wish to jointly compute some (predetermined) function of their inputs~\cite{mpc}. Secure multiparty computation assume malicious behaviour by a subset of participant entities.

The two important requirements of any secure computation protocol are privacy and correctness. The privacy requirement states that the parties should not learn anything else than the output of the computation and the correctness requirement states that that each party should receive its correct output~\cite{mpc}.
