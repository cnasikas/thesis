\label{conclusion}

In this work, we presented a data sharing and processing in a privacy preserving manner platform. Through the platform data controllers can register their datasets and make them available for processing. Data processors can process datasets on behalf of data requestors. Anyone can be a data requestor and request a data processing on a specific dataset and for a specific algorithm.

We use a distributed ledger as the controller of the system. The use of distributed ledger helps to unite trustless entities with shared interests -- the data processing of sensitive datasets. Utilizing the blockchain as the coordinator of the system all actions of participants are recorded. Thus, trasparency, accountability, non-repudation, data provenance, and auditability is enabled. In addition to the blockchain, we use a Zero Knowledge verifiable computation scheme with which the data processors can produce a proof of correct computation without revealing the dataset itself. Requestors can verify proofs and be assured of the validity of the output.

We aim to a fully decentralized data sharing ecosystem where researchers and organization can extract all the valuable information of datasets without compromising privacy.
