\label{conclusion}

In the Big Data area a huge amount of data are being created and gathered in a rapid pace. It is evident that those data can be beneficial for researchers and organizations. However, data can be private and protected by acts, such as GDPR, making data processing impossible. To address this issue we propose a platform where data controllers can register their datasets making them available for processing by data processors on behalf of data requestors.

We use a distributed ledger as the controller of the system. The use of distributed ledgers could help to unite trustless entities with shared interests; the data processing of sensitive datasets. Utilizing the blockchain as a coordinator of the system where all actions of participants are recorded could providing trasparency, accountability, non-repudation, data provenance, and auditability as transaction are immutable. On the other hand, blockchain is not suitable for big data storage and processing. For that reason, an off-chain system should be used.
