\section{Cryptography Building Blocks}
\label{preliminaries:crypto_block}

Cryptography is the art and science of secure communication in the presence of third parties; the adversaries. As such it has an immediate relationship with the privacy and anonymity requirement of data. Blockchain is a strong paradigm of cryptography embracement to enable the sought trust needed for exchanging digital assets. In this section we shall review the basic building blocks that cryptography provides to a data sharing system with the use of Blockchain. The purpose of the section is not about cryptography in itself but to merely lay the ground for the forthcoming chapters. As a result, the exposition style will not be formal in well know cases.

\subsection{Symmetric-key cryptography}
\label{preliminaries:crypto_block:sym}

In a symmetric cryptosystem, two parties share a common secret key that has been agreed prior to communication. The key is used for both encryption and decryption. When a party wants to securely send a message uses the key to encrypt it and the receiver uses the same key to decrypt and recover the message. More formally, a symmetric cryptosystem is composed of the following algorithms~\cite{Katz:2014:IMC:2700550, kiagias:crypto}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A key generation probabilistic algorithm $\calg$ that takes as input a security parameter $\lambda$ it and outputs a key $k$.
  \item An encryption algorithm $\cale$ that takes as input a key $k$ and a plaintext $m$ and outputs a ciphertext $c$.
  \item A decryption algorithm $\cald$ that takes as input a key $k$ and a ciphertext $c$ and outputs a plaintext $m$.
\end{itemize}

The set of all possible keys derived from the key generation algorithm $\calg$ is called the key space $\calk$. Respectively, the set of all possible plaintext is called the plaintext message space, denoted $\calm$, and the set of all possible ciphettexts is called ciphertext message space, denoted $\calc$.

A symmetric cryptosystem must satisfy the correctness property: for all $m \in \calm$ and $k \in \calk$, it holds that

\begin{equation*}
  \cald_{k}(\cale_{k}(m)) = m
\end{equation*}

Any deterministic cryptosystem can not be secure~\cite{Katz:2014:IMC:2700550, kiagias:crypto}. To this end, randomness is essential to an encryption function.
