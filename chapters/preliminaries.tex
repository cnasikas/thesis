\section{Cryptography Building Blocks}
\label{preliminaries:crypto_block}

Cryptography is the art and science of secure communication in the presence of third parties; the adversaries. As such it has an immediate relationship with the privacy and anonymity requirement of data. Blockchain is a strong paradigm of cryptography embracement to enable the sought trust needed for exchanging digital assets. In this section we shall review the basic building blocks that cryptography provides to a data sharing system with the use of Blockchain. The purpose of the section is not about cryptography in itself but to merely lay the ground for the forthcoming chapters. As a result, the exposition style will not be formal in well know cases.

\subsection{Symmetric-key cryptography}
\label{preliminaries:crypto_block:sym}

In a symmetric cryptosystem, two parties share a common secret key that has been agreed prior to communication. The key is used for both encryption and decryption. When a party wants to securely send a message uses the key to encrypt it and the receiver uses the same key to decrypt and recover the message. More formally, a symmetric cryptosystem is composed of the following algorithms~\cite{Katz:2014:IMC:2700550, kiagias:crypto}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A key generation algorithm $\calg$ that takes as input a security parameter $1^{n}$ it and outputs a key $k$.
  \item An encryption algorithm $\cale$ that takes as input a key $k$ and a plaintext $m$ and outputs a ciphertext $c$.
  \item A decryption algorithm $\cald$ that takes as input a key $k$ and a ciphertext $c$ and outputs a plaintext $m$.
\end{itemize}

The set of all possible keys derived from the key generation algorithm $\calg$ is called the key space $\calk$. Respectively, the set of all possible plaintext is called the plaintext message space, denoted $\calm$, and the set of all possible ciphettexts is called ciphertext message space, denoted $\calc$.

A symmetric cryptosystem must satisfy the correctness property: for all $m \in \calm$ and $k \in \calk$, it holds that

\begin{equation*}
  \cald_{k}(\cale_{k}(m)) = m
\end{equation*}

Any deterministic cryptosystem can not be secure~\cite{Katz:2014:IMC:2700550, kiagias:crypto}. To this end, randomness is essential to any encryption scheme.

\subsection{Public Key Cryptography}
\label{preliminaries:crypto_block:pub}

As we see in~\ref{preliminaries:crypto_block:sym} a secret key has to been agreed prior to communication. In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a paper called New Directions in Cryptography~\cite{Diffie:2006:NDC:2263321.2269104} that changed the way of communication. They proposed a protocol that enables two parties, having no prior communication, to establish a secret key over an insecure channel in the presence of eavesdropping adversaries. The protocol uses two keys, one for encryption and one for decryption. The encryption key is called the public key and the decryption key is called the private key. Every party has a key pair consist of a public and a private key. The public key is made available for anyone that want to encrypt a message for the receiver; The receiver may post the public key online beforehand. When a party wants to send a message to another party she use the public key of the person of interest and encrypts the message using that key. The receiver of the message decrypts the ciphertext with the use of her private key. Only the rightful owner of the private key can decrypt a message that was encrypt with the corresponding public key. In an essence, a key pair is an identity and Blockchain technology smartly utilizes that to provide anonymity to the users of the system.

More formally, a public-key encryption scheme is composed of the following probabilistic, polynomial-time algorithms~\cite{Katz:2014:IMC:2700550, kiagias:crypto}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A key generation probabilistic algorithm $\calg$ that takes as input a security parameter $1^{n}$ it and outputs a key pair ($p_k$, $s_k$).
  \item An encryption algorithm $\cale$ that takes as input a public key $p_k$ and a plaintext $m$ and outputs a ciphertext $c$.
  \item A decryption algorithm $\cald$ that takes as input a private key $s_k$ and a ciphertext $c$ and outputs a plaintext $m$.
\end{itemize}

Likewise, a public-key cryptosystem must satisfy the correctness property: for all $m \in \calm$ and $(p_k, s_k) \in \calk$, it holds that

\begin{equation*}
  \cald_{s_k}(\cale_{p_k}(m)) = m
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Diffie–Hellman key exchange}
\label{preliminaries:crypto_block:pub:dh}

The protocol works as follows~\cite{Katz:2014:IMC:2700550, kiagias:crypto}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Alice and Bob  with the use of a group generation algorithm $\calg$ agree on the description of a finite group $\G$ with input $1^{n}$. The common input for Alice and Bob is the tuple $(p, m, g)$ where $p$ is a large prime and $g$ is the generator of the finite group $\G$ of order $m$.
  \item Alice choose a random index $x_a \rselect{\Z_m}$ and computes $y_a \leftarrow{g^{x_a}}modp$. Alice sends $y_a$ to Bob.
  \item Alice choose a random index $x_b \rselect{\Z_m}$ and computes $y_b \leftarrow{g^{x_b}}modp$. Alice sends $y_b$ to Bob.
  \item Alice outputs $k = y_b^{x_a} = g^{{x_a}{x_b}}modp$
  \item Bob outputs $k = y_a^{x_b} = g^{{x_a}{x_b}}modp$
\end{enumerate}

The security of Diffie–Hellman key exchange is based on the difficulty of the discrete log problem (DLOG), which is the problem of computing $x$ given $g^{x}$ in a cyclic group $\G$. A passive adversary cannot compute the private key $k$ because she does not know $x_a$ or $x_b$. To find them she have to compute the discrete log which is assumed to be hard.

\subsubsection{The RSA Cryptosystem}
\label{preliminaries:crypto_block:pub:rsa}

The RSA cryptosystem~\cite{rsa} was developed in 1977 at MIT by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamer, and Leonard Adleman and is still the most widely used. It was the first public-key encryption scheme that could both encrypt and sign messages~\cite{kiagias:crypto}.

It works as follows~\cite{Katz:2014:IMC:2700550, kiagias:crypto}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Key Generation:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Select randomly to large primes $p, q$ of length $n$ bits
      \item Compute $N = p*q$
      \item Calculate $\phi(N) = (p - 1)(q - 1)$
      \item Find $e$ such that $gcd(e, \phi(N)) = 1$
      \item Compute $d = e^{-1} mod\phi(N)$
      \item Public key is $(N, e)$ and private key is $(N, e)$
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Encryption: On input a public key $p_k = (N, e)$ and a message $m$ it computes the ciphertext $c$ as $ Enc_{p_k}(m) = m^{e}modN$
  \item Decryption: On input a private key $p_k = (N, d)$ and a ciphertext $c$ it computes the message $m$ as $ Dec_{s_k}(c) = c^{d}modN = m^{ed}modN = m$
\end{itemize}

If $p, q$ are known or obvious any interested party can compute $\phi(N)$ and therefore $d$. The RSA Cryptosystem is secure under the assumption that factorization of $N$ is believed to be hard.

The above mention protocol is not secure as the encryption function is deterministic and for the same input is produces the same output. As mention, a deterministic cryptosystem is not secure. One way to randomize the encryption function, is by appending random padding to message.

\subsubsection{The El Gamal Cryptosystem}
\label{preliminaries:crypto_block:pub:el_gamal}

The El Gamal Cryptosystem~\cite{el_gamal} is another popular and wide-used encryption scheme. It is based on the Diffie–Hellman key exchange and the security of the system is based on the hardness of discrete log problem. It works as follows~\cite{Katz:2014:IMC:2700550, kiagias:crypto}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Key generation:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Run a group generation algorithm $\calg$ to produce the description of a finite group $\G$ with input $1^{n}$. The output is the tuple $(p, m, g)$ where $p$ is a large prime and $g$ is the generator of the finite group $\G$ of order $m$.
        \item Select randomly $x \rselect{\Z_m}$
        \item Calculate $h = g^{x}modp$
        \item The public key is $((p, m, g), h>$
        \item The secret key is $x$
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Encryption: Encrypts a message $m \in \G$
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Choose randomly $r \rselect{\Z_m}$
      \item Compute $G = g^{r}modp$
      \item Compute $M = mh^{r}modp$
      \item Return $c = (G, M)$
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Decryption: Decrypts a ciphertext $c = (G, M)$
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Compute $m = M / G^{x} modp$
      \item Return $m$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

Another way to express the security of El Gamal scheme is under the decisional Diffie Hellman problem (DDH) which states that the tuples $(g^a, g^b, g^c)$ and $(g^a, g^b, g^{ab})$ are indistinguishable by a probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) adversary.
