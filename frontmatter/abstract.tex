\abstractEn{
  Data are gathered constantly, grow exponentially, and are considered a valuable asset. The need for extensive analysis has emerge by various organizations and researchers. However, they can be sensitive, private, and protected by privacy disclosure acts making data processing by third-parties almost impossible. We propose a protocol for data processing where data controllers can registered their datasets and entities can request data processing operations. An external blockchain is used as the controller of the system serving as a tamper-proof log of actions. The use of blockchain can support data accountability, auditability and provenance tracking. We also use a Zero Knowledge Verifiable Computation scheme where a data processor is enforced to produce a proof of correctness of computation without revealing the dataset itself.
