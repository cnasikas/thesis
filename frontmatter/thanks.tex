  I wish to first and foremost thank my father for his total support through those year of my studies and not only. He was always there at my most harsh moments of my life. His wisdom and inner peace is crucial to my life.

  I am indebted to my dear friend George Argyros for his help, mentoring, guidance, support, and for introducing me to the world of security and cryptography. Without him it would be impossible to graduate.

  I thank Dionysis Zindros for his key observations, guidance and support. He was always patiently trying to answer my questions.

  I would like to thank all the members of the Cryptography Lab at the University of Athens for their support and help during my stay there.

  I would like also to thank my love Katerina for her support, patience and understanding during my postgraduate course. She was always there for me.

  Finally, I thank my sister, my brother, and my mother for being my dear family. I love you all.
