  I wish to first and foremost thank my father for his total support through those year of my studies and not only. He was always there at my most harsh moments of my life. His wisdom and inner peace is crucial to my life.

  I am indebted to my dear friend George Argyros for his help, mentoring, guidance, support, and for introducing me to the world of security and cryptography. Without him it would be impossible to graduate.

  I would like also to thank Katerina for her support, patience and understanding during my postgraduate course. She was always there for me.

  I thank Dionysis Zindros for his key observations and guidance.

  Finally, I thank my sister, my brother, and my mother for being my dear family. I love you all.
